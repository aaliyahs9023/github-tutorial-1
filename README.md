# GitHub Tutorial

## Git vs. GitHub
* Git is a version control which means it keeps snapshots of all your code, so that you can be able to look back at your old code. (It doesn't require github)
* Github stores code into the cloud. You can track your changes easily and you can collaborate on files. (It doesn't require git)
  *  It runs in the command line and it's basic workflow which means you have a directory in where you can initialize git and call it a repository.

## Initial Setup
* Go to [github](https://github.com/)
* With making a github account, if you're a HSTAT student then use your Hstat email to create it, but if you're not then use an email you regularly use. 
  * After this, you should end up pressing free account and making your first repository
